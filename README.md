An inventory management system in Python. And yes the words *Python* and *inventory* are combined.

## Additional Features

Besides the standard CRUD functionalities and the additional features mentioned in the [assignment brief](AssignmentBrief.pdf), these are something extra:

- **Search Engine:** A search functionality for products.
- **Login (Basic):** Basic login page for user authentication.
- **Data Storage (CSV):** Product data is stored in CSV format for persistence.
- **User Experience?** Not exactly a feature, but the idea is present throughout the whole program, from using appropriate whitespace, to colored text, etc.
